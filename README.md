# iMAS Secure Memory

## Background

The "iMAS Secure Memory" framework provides a set of tools for securing, clearing, and validating memory regions and individual variables.  It allows an object to have it's data sections overwritten in memory either with an encrypted version or null bytes.

## Vulnerabilities Addressed


## Installation


```
    cd ~/Documents/code/YourApp

    git clone https://github.com/project-imas/memory-security.git
```
  * Click on the top level Project item and add files ("option-command-a")
  * Navigate to **memory-security**, highlight **IMSHandler**, and click **Add**
  * In any file you'd like to use the memory manager import IMSMemoryManager.h:
```objc
   #import "IMSMemoryManager.h"
```

## API
```
  // Find the data portion of the object's memory and zero it out
  wipe(NSObject* obj); 
 
  // Encrypt an object's data in memory with a given password
  lock(NSObject* obj, NSString* pass); 
  
  // Decrypt an object's data in memory with a given password
  unlock(NSObject* obj, NSString* pass); 
  
  // Provide a string with the memory address and checksum of the object
  checksum(NSObject* obj);
  
  // Add the object to a pointer list that wipeAll, lockAll, unlockAll, and checksum operations effect
  track(NSObject* obj);
  
  // Remove the object from the tracked list
  untrack(NSObject* obj);
  
  // Wipe all tracked objects
  wipeAll();
  
  // Lock all tracked objects with the provided password
  lockAll(NSString* pass);
  
  // Unlock all tracked objects with the provided password
  unlockAll(NSString* pass);
  
  // Provide and statically stores a string off all tracked memory addresses and object checksums
  checksumMem();
  
  // Test whether the current memory state of all tracked objects matches the state it was in when checksumMem was called
  // YES if checksums matched, NO otherwise
  checksumTest();
``` 

## Caution on password usage

## Use case 1: Sensitive variable clearing

Suppose we have a variable that contains sensitive data, we want to limit it's time in memory so that if an attacker gets access to the program's runnign memory they have less chance of seeing it. One strategy is to immediately wipe an object's memory right after use:

```
   NSString* sensitiveData;
   // Processing of sensitive data
   wipe(sensitiveData);
```

This ensures that the data is only in memory during the processing.  


Similarly we could unlock the data and immediately lock it again every time a sensitive variable is used:

![Lock Unlock Example](readmeImages/lockUnlockExample.JPG)


```
   NSString* sensitiveData;
   NSString* somePassword;
   
   unlock(sensitiveData, somePassword);
   // Processing of sensitive data
   lock(sensitiveData, somePassword);
   
   wipe(somePassword);
```

## Use case 2: Wiping memory when application is not active

When the device is locked, the app closed (hidden or terminated) we want to wipe all sensitive data.

![Wipe on exit example](readmeImages/wipeAllExample.JPG)

We start by tracking variables we care about up front:
```
   NSString* obj1;
   NSData* obj2;
   NSArray* obj3;
   
   track(obj1);
   track(obj2);
   track(obj3);
```

Then inside of your program's **AppDelegate.m** add wipeAll to the resign and terminate functions:
```
- (void)applicationWillResignActive:(UIApplication *)application
{
   wipeAll();
}

- (void)applicationWillTerminate:(UIApplication *)application
{
   wipeAll();
}
```

A program could also add the ability to lockAll() and unlockAll() to WillResignActive and DidBecomeActive functions respectively.

## Use case 3: Check for memory tampering

We may want to see if an attacker or external process is modifying our applications memory for sensitive data.  By tracking variables in regions and periodically using the checksum features we may be able to detect this.

![Checksum example](readmeImages/checksumExample.JPG)

Initial tracking and checksum:
```
   NSString* obj1;
   NSData* obj2;
   NSArray* obj3;
   
   track(obj1);
   track(obj2);
   track(obj3);
   
   checksumMem();
```

Before using a variable:
```
   if(checksumTest() == NO) {
      wipeAll();
      // ALERT Something is bad
   } else {
      obj1 = someNewThing(1);
      obj2 = someNewThing(2);
      obj3 = someNewThing(3);
      checksumMem();
   }
```
